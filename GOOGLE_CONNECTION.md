# GOOGLE_CONNECTION.md — connecting this app to Google Sheets, Gmail and Chat

Read this whole file before making this app read or write a Google Sheet, draft or send email, or post to Google Chat.

## How it works

This app's **backend cannot reach Google** — it has no Google login. Instead, the **web page** (running in the user's signed-in Chrome) calls the champion's own **App Connector**: an Apps Script web app inside their Sandbox v3 sheet. The call uses a `<script>` tag (JSONP), because a normal `fetch()` to Apps Script is blocked.

```
Web page (browser, signed in to Google) → App Connector (/exec URL) → Sheet / Gmail / Chat
```

The App Connector is already written. It is the file `AppConnector.gs` in the champion's sheet. **Do not write or change Apps Script code for this.** Only write the web page side.

**What the connector allows is set by the champion in three tabs of their sheet, not in code:**
- `Connector_Tabs`: which tabs the app may read, which columns it may change, and which tabs it may add rows to;
- `Connector_Email`: who the app may email;
- `Connector_AI`: the named AI questions the app may ask.

**Always call `describe` first.** It returns the tabs, their column headers, what's allowed on each, the AI question names and the Chat spaces. Build the page from what `describe` returns. Don't guess tab or column names. If something the user wants isn't allowed, tell them which setting to add in which tab, rather than working around it.

## Hard rules

1. **This is browser code by design.** Call the App Connector from the web page's JavaScript, not from Python. (AI_CONNECTION.md's "backend only" rule applies to the AI gateway, not to this.)
2. **Get the `/exec` URL from the backend at page load**, from an environment variable `APPS_SCRIPT_URL`, via a route such as `GET /api/config`. Never write the URL into code or commit it.
3. **Treat the `/exec` URL like a password.** Anyone who has it can make the connector act as the champion, from any website. Never print it on the page, in logs, or in error messages.
4. **Every write sends a new `request_id`** (one per click). This stops double-clicks and refreshes from doing the same thing twice.
5. **Keep each call under 8 KB.** Everything travels in the URL. The helper below refuses larger calls before sending.
6. **Ask before sending email.** A `send` must follow a confirmation that shows the recipient, subject and body. Prefer `draft` when a person should review first.
7. **Show errors exactly as received:** `code`, `message_en`, `message_zh`.
8. **Only use the actions listed below.** The connector refuses anything else.
9. **The app can't send its own AI prompt through the connector.** It picks a named question from `Connector_AI`. If the user needs a new AI question, tell them the exact row to add to `Connector_AI`. (For free-form AI inside the app, use the AI gateway from the backend — see AI_CONNECTION.md.)

## Setting up (the champion does this once)

1. In the sheet, run `setupConnector` once (Extensions → Apps Script → choose `setupConnector` → Run). This creates the three settings tabs with examples. Edit them for what the app needs.
2. For Chat: add `CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL` in **Project Settings → Script Properties**. Extra spaces go in `CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL_<NAME>`, e.g. `CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL_FINANCE`.
3. Run `testConnector` and read the Execution log. It lists what's allowed and flags mistakes.
4. **Deploy → New deployment → Web app**. Execute as **Me**. Who has access: **Anyone within Ninja Van**. Copy the URL ending in `/exec`.
5. Set `APPS_SCRIPT_URL` in this app with the env commands described in AGENTS.md (not a secret, but never commit it).
6. **Redeploy** the app.
7. Use **Chrome, in a normal window, signed in to your Ninja Van Google account only.** Incognito, Safari, and browsers signed in to more than one Google account have not been tested.

## Actions

| `action` | Parameters | Returns (on success, `ok: true`) |
|---|---|---|
| `ping` | — | `active_user`, `owner`, `time` |
| `describe` | — | `tabs` (each: `tab`, `headers`, `can_read`, `key_column`, `can_change`, `can_add_rows`, `add_columns`), `ai_questions` (each: `name`, `tab`, `key_column`, `uses_input`), `chat_spaces` |
| `read` | `tab`; optional `where_column` + `where_value` (exact match, not case-sensitive); optional `limit` (max 200) | `headers`, `rows` (arrays of text), `total`, `truncated` |
| `add` | `request_id`, `tab`, `values` = JSON text of `{"Column": "value"}` | `row_number`. `Request_ID`, `Created_At` and `Created_By` are filled automatically if the tab has those columns |
| `update` | `request_id`, `tab`, `key` (the row's value in its key column), `changes` = JSON text of `{"Column": "new value"}` | `before`, `after` |
| `draft` | `request_id`, `to`, `subject`, `body` | `draft_id` — a Gmail draft, not sent |
| `send` | `request_id`, `to`, `subject`, `body` | `sent_to` — **really sends** |
| `chat` | `request_id`, `text`; optional `space` (a name from `chat_spaces`) | `chat_status` |
| `ai` | `request_id`, `question` (a name from `ai_questions`), `key` (if the question has a tab); optional `input` (extra text, max 1000 characters) | `text` — the AI's answer |

Email (`draft`, `send`) goes to **one address only**, and only to an address allowed in `Connector_Email` (a listed address, a whole domain, or a column in a tab), or to the champion.

A repeated `request_id` returns `duplicate: true` and does nothing.

Every failure returns:
```json
{ "ok": false, "error": { "code": "RECIPIENT_NOT_ALLOWED", "message_en": "...", "message_zh": "..." } }
```

Error messages name the tab and setting to fix. Show them to the user as they are.

## JavaScript helper — copy this into the web page

```javascript
let APPS_SCRIPT_URL = null;
const MAX_URL_LENGTH = 8000;
const CALL_TIMEOUT_MS = 20000;

async function loadAppsScriptUrl() {
  const res = await fetch("/api/config");
  const cfg = await res.json();
  APPS_SCRIPT_URL = cfg.apps_script_url;
  if (!APPS_SCRIPT_URL) throw new Error("APPS_SCRIPT_URL is not set on this app.");
}

function newRequestId() {
  return "req-" + Date.now() + "-" + Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 10);
}

function callAppsScript(params) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (!APPS_SCRIPT_URL) {
      reject({ code: "NOT_CONFIGURED", message_en: "The app has not loaded its settings yet.", message_zh: "应用还没有加载设置。" });
      return;
    }
    const callback = "__appsScript_" + Date.now() + "_" + Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);
    const url = new URL(APPS_SCRIPT_URL);
    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(params)) url.searchParams.set(key, String(value));
    url.searchParams.set("callback", callback);

    if (url.toString().length > MAX_URL_LENGTH) {
      reject({ code: "TOO_MUCH_DATA", message_en: "Too much text for one call. Shorten it.", message_zh: "一次发送的文字太多，请缩短。" });
      return;
    }

    const script = document.createElement("script");
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      cleanup();
      reject({ code: "NO_REPLY", message_en: "The sheet connector did not reply. Check you are in Chrome, signed in to your Ninja Van account only.", message_zh: "表格连接器没有回应。请确认你在使用 Chrome，并且只登录了 Ninja Van 账号。" });
    }, CALL_TIMEOUT_MS);

    function cleanup() {
      clearTimeout(timer);
      delete window[callback];
      script.remove();
    }

    window[callback] = (payload) => {
      cleanup();
      if (payload && payload.ok) resolve(payload);
      else reject((payload && payload.error) || { code: "UNKNOWN", message_en: "Unknown error.", message_zh: "未知错误。" });
    };

    script.onerror = () => {
      cleanup();
      reject({ code: "LOAD_FAILED", message_en: "Could not reach the sheet connector. The data may be too large, or APPS_SCRIPT_URL is wrong.", message_zh: "无法连接表格连接器。可能是数据太多，或 APPS_SCRIPT_URL 填错了。" });
    };

    script.async = true;
    script.src = url.toString();
    document.head.appendChild(script);
  });
}
```

Example uses:
```javascript
await loadAppsScriptUrl();

const allowed = await callAppsScript({ action: "describe" });

const late = await callAppsScript({ action: "read", tab: "Shipments",
                                     where_column: "SLA_Breach", where_value: "YES" });

await callAppsScript({ action: "update", request_id: newRequestId(), tab: "Shipments",
                       key: "SBX-100021", changes: JSON.stringify({ Remarks: "Called customer" }) });

await callAppsScript({ action: "add", request_id: newRequestId(), tab: "App_Entries",
                       values: JSON.stringify({ Tracking_ID: "SBX-100021", Note: "Escalated" }) });

const email = await callAppsScript({ action: "ai", request_id: newRequestId(),
                                     question: "follow_up_email", key: "SBX-100021" });

await callAppsScript({ action: "draft", request_id: newRequestId(),
                       to: "ka-alerts@sandbox.example", subject: "Update on SBX-100021", body: "..." });

await callAppsScript({ action: "chat", request_id: newRequestId(), text: "SBX-100021 escalated" });
```

Backend route for the setting:
```python
import os

@app.get("/api/config")
def config():
    return {"apps_script_url": os.environ.get("APPS_SCRIPT_URL", "")}
```

Keep the app's **Google SSO turned on**, so only Ninja Van staff can load the page and its settings.

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `LOAD_FAILED` | Data too large, or wrong URL | Send less text; check `APPS_SCRIPT_URL` ends in `/exec` |
| `NO_REPLY` | The browser couldn't use your Google login | Chrome, normal window, Ninja Van account only |
| A Google sign-in page | Not signed in to an allowed account | Sign in to your Ninja Van Google account |
| `TAB_NOT_ALLOWED`, `ADD_NOT_ALLOWED`, `CHANGE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `COLUMN_NOT_ALLOWED` | The settings don't allow it | Change the row for that tab in `Connector_Tabs` — no redeploy needed |
| `PROTECTED_TAB` | Settings, log and Config tabs can never be opened | Put the data in a different tab |
| `RECIPIENT_NOT_ALLOWED` | Address not allowed | Add the address, its domain (`@company.com`) or its column (`Tab!Column`) to `Connector_Email` |
| `QUESTION_NOT_FOUND` | No such AI question | Add a row to `Connector_AI` |
| `NO_WEBHOOK` | Chat address missing | Add `CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL` (or `CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL_<NAME>`) in Script Properties |
| `MISSING_REQUEST_ID` | The page didn't send one | Use `newRequestId()` for every write |
| Changed the connector **code** but nothing changed | The deployment still runs the old version | Deploy → Manage deployments → edit → Version: New version. (Settings-tab changes don't need this.) |
